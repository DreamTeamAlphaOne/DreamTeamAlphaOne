# Pix R Picks Frontend

## App Overview

Pix R Picks is an app which allows users to enter an emotion based on facial analysis or a button selection. They will then be suggested a Pixar movie that heavily includes that emotion. The user can also save a list of the movies that they like and will be able to check that list at any point as well as edit the list. This back end is responsible for taking the input emotion and searching all contained movies and emotion scores to return the approprate movie as well as keeping track of all saved movies.
